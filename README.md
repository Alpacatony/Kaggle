## [Fraud Detection Kaggle Project - link](https://github.com/Alpacatony/Kaggle/blob/main/fraud-detection-21-1-2023.ipynb)

## Project Goal
Credit card companies need to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
I need to build a machine learning model to detect fraud accurately.

## Tools
Python | Numpy | Pandas | Scikit-learn | Logistic Regression

## Personal Goal
My goal was to implement a logistic regression from a set of data that needed to be cleaned, select features, and implement a model to detect
credit card fraud. I also wanted to use new techniques I learned to analyse the data such as heat mapping and pair plots.
